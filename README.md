Unit 1 project - Random Quote Generator

First project of the Team Treehouse Full Stack Javascript Techdegree.
Created a web app that will display random curated quotes. The quotes will change at random every 10 seconds or by pressing a button at the top of the app. With every random quote, the background color will change as well.
